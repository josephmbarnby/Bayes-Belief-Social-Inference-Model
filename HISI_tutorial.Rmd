## Understanding the model

The anatomy of the HISI model.

![Experimental Design](ModelSchematic.png)

## Here is the model

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

# Give it some fake decisions from a partner
data = data.frame(ret = c(sample(c(0.5, 0), 10, replace = T, prob = c(0.8, 0.2)),
                   sample(c(0.5, 0), 10, replace = T, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))),
                  HI = rep(0.5, 20),
                  SI = rep(0.5, 20))

# Give it some parameters
parameters <- c(0.5, 2, 0.5, 4, 1, 0, 0.5, 2, 0.5)

# Run the model 
xy <- infHISIll_20d(parameters, data, details = T, tn = 10, phase = 2, plot = 1, sim_only = 1)

#Look at the data
xy$policy

```

## Understanding the functions

An anatomy of the HISI model wrapper: NB not intended for running

```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

simulatedata_HISI(

  x = 'none',            # As default, this will tell the function you want to input specific parameters
                         # You can set the string to a particular parameter if you want to test multiple
                         # values of that parameter, e.g. change it to 'wSI'
   
  values = 10,           # If you want to sweep through a parameter, how many values do you want to test?
   
  samples = 100,         # How many synthetic participants do you want to produce per sweep?
   
  trials = 50,           # How many trials do you want to include? If you set 'partners' > 1, this is will the
                         # the amount of trials per partner (e.g. partner = 2, and you set 50 trials, so there will
                         # be 100 trials simulated in total, 50 per partner type)
   
  partners = 2,          # How many partners are the synthetic participants playing? Can be between 1-3

  partner_type = 'fair', # If the synthetic participants are only with one partner, which one should they 
                         # be matched with?   Can be 'fair', 'unfair' or 'random'.

  plot = 1               # Do you want to visualize the output? The function will return simulated data as standard,
                         # and then also a plot of the data over time if you set plot = 1.
  
  #...                   # There are default parameter values set within the function:
                         # pHI0 = 0.5, uHI0 = 2, pSI0 = 0.5, uSI0 = 2, uPi = 2, w0 = 0, wHI = 0.5, wSI = 0.5, eta = 0.5
                         # If you want to change these values, simply add extra arguments, e.g.:
                         # pHI0 = 0.9, uHI0 = 5.
                         # If x = 'none' this is where you define your specific parameters of interest to simulate
)

```

## Simulating some data

Here I am asking the function to sweep through 10 different values of
pHI0 between 0 and 1 but keep all other parameters constant. I want 100
participants to be simulated per values. I am also asking for the
participants to play 2 'types' of partner, and the function will
simulate each presented order (i.e., fair -> unfair, and unfair ->
fair).

```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

simulatedata_HISI(x = 'pHI0', values = 10, samples = 100, trials = 10, partners = 2, plot = 1, upi = 0.9)

```

Here I am asking for the same but I only want to save the data without
plotting

```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

mytestdata <- simulatedata_HISI(x = 'pHI0', values = 10, samples = 100, trials = 10, partners = 2, plot = 0)
mytestdata

```

In this particular version, I want to only play one type of partner, and
they'll be giving the participants randomly fair or unfair outcomes. I
am also setting the uHI0 parameter to 5 while I sweep through pHI0
values

```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

simulatedata_HISI(x = 'upi01', 
                  values = 10, 
                  samples = 100, 
                  trials = 50, 
                  partners = 1, 
                  partner_type = 'unfair', 
                  plot = 1,
                  uHI0 = 5)
```

Finally I want to simulate three different partners, but with specific parameters set

```{r, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE, results='hide'}

simulatedata_HISI(x = 'pHI0', values = 10, samples = 50, trials = 50, partners = 2, plot = 1,
                  uHI0 = 2,
                  pSI0 = 0.3,
                  uSI0 = 2,
                  upi  = 0.9,
                  w0   = -1,
                  wHI  = 0.5,
                  wSI  = 0.5,
                  eta  = 1)

```

# Recover the model

This recovery function samples random parameter values from normal
distributions and then attempts to recover them using simulated data
produced from the sampled parameters.

This uses weak regularizing priors over the optimizer, providing Maximum
A-Priori estimation. The optimiser used 'DEoptim' - a differential evolution
algorithm, which behaves a little like expectation maximisation algorithms.

```{r Recovery, echo = F, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

cores = 4
RecoverModel_HISI(
  variations = 150,          # how many samples of parameters need to be drawn from a normal distribution?
  trials = 10,               # how many trials will the synthetic participants play with each partner?
  partners = 2,              # how many partners/styles of partner will they see?
  partner_type = 'fair',     # if partner = 1, what type of partner will they see?
  corrplot = 1,              # do you want to see a correlation of the parameters at the end?,
  n_cores = cores

)

```

# Fitting some data

This fitting function allows Maximum-A-Priori (MAP) approximation for
all parameters within the model, using a differential evolution optimiser.

This works best with larger populations (\> 100) to reduce estimation
noise across the entire group.

The data input needs to be a list, with each entry being a participants
returns for each trial, and their harmful intent and self interest
attributions, and trial number, in that order. E.g:

| Return | Harmful Intent | Self Interest | Trial |
|:------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 0.5    | 50             | 50            | 1     |
| 0      | 60             | 65            | 2     |
| 0      | 60             | 70            | 3     |
| ...    | ...            | ...           | n     |

I am working on a hierarchical implementation to fit the model, although this is a WIP. 
Please get in touch if you'd like to help with this!

## Fit model to data using MAP appoximation

```{r, echo = F, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

load('ExampleData.Rdata')
 
#Fit the model using MAP estimation and visualize the distributions of parameters and quality of model fit
Fitted_Values <- FitModel_HISI(ExampleData, plot = 1, cores = 4, tn = 10, phase = 2)

Fitted_Values[[1]] # This is the data with estimated parameters
Fitted_Values[[2]] # This is the simulated data using the parameters from Fitted_Values[[1]]
Fitted_Values[[3]] # These are the plots to check the parameter approximation and overall model fit

```
